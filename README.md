## About me
Hi! I'm Eugene and I'm begginner **front-end developer**, I'm graduating from Belorussian state medical university in 2021 and starting to work as ENT (othorhinolaryngologist) doctor. Also in this year I started learning Front-end development and have some success in this.

From march 2021 I am taking [**javascript\front-end rolling-scopes school**](https://rs.school/js/) course. I had a little experience in HTML as a child and a huge interest in programming. In my sixth year of university I had free time and decided to try something new, interesting and useful, so I asked my friend that already work in IT to help me look around. According to his advices I started my prepairing to RSS course and in two months I reached required level of knowledge for passing it. Due to huge amount of tasks (studying at the university, part-time as a nurse at a children's hospital, learning Front-end assosiated materials and solving course tasks) I became better at planning my time.  Studying in IT sphere awakens the feeling that nothing is impossible, and with some effort I can learn anything. I really became curious about solving tasks for last monthes. I read a lot of materials about css and its possibilities now, about programming patterns, trying to get information about NodeJS, and field of work constantly grow for me, but I don't scared, because it so exiting! 

My latest project was [online-zoo](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/eugene-smirnov-JSFE2021Q1/online-zoo/pages/landing/), where I get lots of expirience in SASS, CSS-variables. Now I working on SPA using Typescript, webpack and some modules called "match-match game".
