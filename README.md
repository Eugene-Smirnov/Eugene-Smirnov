## About me
Hi! I'm Eugene and I'm begginner **front-end developer**, I'm graduating from Belorussian state medical university in 2021 and starting to work as ENT (othorhinolaryngologist) doctor. Also in this year I found a new hobby that may become my main working activity.

From march 2021 I am taking [**javascript\front-end rolling-scopes school**](https://rs.school/js/) course. When I discovered it from my friend I was armed only with desire to enter the IT sphere. According to his advices I started my prepairing to course and in two months I reached required level of knowledge for passing it. Due to huge amount of tasks (studying at the university, part-time as a nurse at a children's hospital, learning Front-end assosiated materials and solving course tasks) I became better at planning my time and stopped wasting it. Studying in IT sphere awakens the feeling that nothing is impossible, and with some effort I can learn anything.

My latest project was [online-zoo](https://rolling-scopes-school.github.io/eugene-smirnov-JSFE2021Q1/online-zoo/pages/landing/), where I get lots of expirience in SASS, CSS-variables, and other modern tools. Check out it above to get my skill representation.
