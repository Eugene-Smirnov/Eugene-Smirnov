## About me
Hi! I'm Eugene and I'm begginner **front-end developer**, I'm graduating from Belorussian state medical university in 2021 and in this year I started learning Front-end development and have some success in this.

From march 2021 I am taking [**javascript\front-end rolling-scopes school**](https://rs.school/js/) course. I had a little experience in HTML as a child and a huge interest in programming. In my sixth year of university I had free time and decided to try something new, interesting and useful, so I asked my friend that already work in IT to help me look around. According to his advices I started my prepairing to RSS course and in two months I reached required level of knowledge for passing it. I really became curious about solving tasks and implement different algorythms for last monthes. I read a lot of materials about JS, CSS and their possibilities, about programming patterns and best practicies for last half-year, I trying to get information about NodeJS, and other technologies that I need to implement course tasks well. Field of work constantly grow for me, but I don't scared, because it so exiting! 

During solving my last task on course I started to work with Typescript and webpack, and I created simple SPA called ["match-match game"](https://eugene-smirnov-match-match.netlify.app). It was hard to start but very intersting then to work on it. Now I feel real difference in knowledge and feel ready to start with more difficult projects.
