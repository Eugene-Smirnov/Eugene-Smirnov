## About me

Hi! I'm Eugene and I'm **front-end developer**, I'm graduated from Belorussian state medical university in 2021 and starting to work as ENT (othorhinolaryngologist) doctor. Also in this year I found a new hobby that may become my main working activity.

From december 2020 till end of july 2021 I passed [**javascript\front-end rolling-scopes school**](https://rs.school/js/) course (checkout my [sertificate](https://app.rs.school/certificate/lzvcxj6w) :D ). It was difficult to combine work, study in university and programming, but studying was really exiting. Studying in IT sphere awakens the feeling that nothing is impossible, and with some effort I can learn anything.

My latest project was [english-for-kids](https://eugene-smirnov-english-for-kids.netlify.app/), SPA created for learning english in game style. With help of my menthor I decided to code this project using React and Redux, so at first it was hard to meet deadline requierments, but then I realised how these technologies can simplify my life, and started use them. In second part we code admin panel with simple token authentification, CRUD operations on categories and cards, and moved all logic to the express server. I tried to pass second course on server NodeJS in may, and the knowledge that I got there helped me a lot. Also I'm realy like how this app looks and works, we had got basic figma mockup but I changed style and added some functionality to make app look better.

Now I started learninng Angular on RSS Angular 2021q3 course. It looks more complicated than React for me, so I decided that learning React I could do on my own.
